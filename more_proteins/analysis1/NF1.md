## 1. Architecture and the domain pair

| domain | range | length |
|---|---|--:|
| Ras-GAP | 1251–1482 | 232 |
| CRAL-TRIO | 1580–1738 | 159 |

**Pair analysed:** Ras-GAP ↔ CRAL-TRIO

### Inter-domain geometry per structure

| structure | centroid Å | contacts | coverage |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| 7r03.1.A (100.0% id) | 42.0 | 1 | 100% / 100% |
| 7r04.1.A (100.0% id) | 74.1 | 0 | 100% / 100% |

## 2. The inter-domain interface

Most compact structure: `P21359_7r03-1-A.pdb`, centroid distance **42.0 Å**, **1 residue pairs** in contact within 5 Å.

**Domain A interface residues (1):** `1428`

**Domain B interface residues (1):** `1669`

### Are interface variants different? (Mann–Whitney, interface vs the rest)

| feature | n interface | n other | median interface | median other | p |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| FoldX ΔΔG | 40 | 84,203 | 0.679 | 1.041 | 0.83 |

## 3. Feature coverage and independence

| feature | variants scored |
|---|--:|
| AlphaMissense | 0 |
| ESM-1v | 0 |
| FoldX ΔΔG (ProtVar) | 84,243 |
| ThermoMPNN ΔΔG | 0 |


## 4. ClinVar and gnomAD

No ClinVar-linked variants in the Liao & Lehner table for this protein.

**gnomAD r4 missense variants mapped:** 2,601

## 5. Two-cluster split (the Jeanpierre/Debeaupuis step)

Not enough jointly-scored variants to cluster.

## 6. ProteinGym

**Absent** from the 217 ProteinGym DMS substitution assays, so no published experimental variant data and no precomputed baselines for this protein.

### Caveats carried from the method work

- **ΔΔG magnitudes are unreliable**; ranks are usable. FoldX and ThermoMPNN disagree by a factor of ~40 on the equilibrium shift for a single variant (`PTPN2/jeanpierre2024_variant_analysis.md` §2.1b).
- **ΔΔG is a mechanism channel, not a pathogenicity score** — ρ ≈ 0.26–0.28 against DMS data against ≈ 0.35–0.40 for sequence predictors (`external_data/ddg_study.md` §5).
- **A ΔΔG near zero with AlphaMissense near 1 identifies a functional-site variant** with no structural cost — the PTPN2 C216S pattern.
- **Interface residues come from the most compact structure available.** Where that is an AlphaFold model rather than an experiment, the interface is predicted, not observed.
